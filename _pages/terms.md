## ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

All rights on the pages are reserved and owned by Tolenas Winery. Copyright 2020. Please use the [**CONTACT FORM**](https://tolenaswinery.com/contact) if you have any questions or would like to know about gaining rights to anything on these pages. 

## DO NOT SELL MY INFO

Our company does not currently qualify as a "certain business" that requires compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, we have chosen to comply regardless. This law is the most pro-consumer law in the country at this time and thus we feel that these standards more than meet the needs of any state. This policy does not, however, govern the terms of our relationship or constitute any representation or warranty.

## RIGHT TO KNOW

Under the CCPA you are entitled to a "right to know" what information we collect on you.

When you visit our website, our statistics package from Google collects some basic information about your browser. Examples include what type of browser and operating system you are using, how long you remained on our site and what pages you looked at while here. This helps us understand how visitors browse our site, so that we can make their shopping experience better. We also collect personal information about you at various points, including your name and email address (and other information) from the mailing list sign-up form, and additional personal and financial information from the order forms that you complete during a purchase.

This website may contain links to other websites or third party service providers. Our company is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

The information you provide to us on this website is only used to send you our offers, and to process and ship your order. We may also use this information to send you information regarding new features, services, service ads and special offers from us and/or our business partners that we think you'll find valuable.

This information is harvested from a secure area and encrypted for our customers' protection. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others, except as otherwise disclosed in this statement. Although we use outside shipping companies to ship orders and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We value your privacy, and will never release any account or personal information to any third party unless we are given explicit authority to do so by you, our customer.

Our company reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

Our company reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information to vendors of ours that assist with marketing, SEO, Ads or other services to deliver our products to you so long as vendors agree to the terms of these policies.

## RIGHT TO DELETE

Under the CCPA you are entitled to a "right to delete" what information we store about you.

# RIGHT TO OPT-OUT

Under the CCPA you are entitled to a "right to opt-out" sale of information we have about you. At this time, our company sells no information to any other party or third party and thus a consumer would not need to opt-out.

Our company reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, with or without notice to its customers. However, should we ever decide to sell your information we will notify consumers first with the right to opt out.

If you would like to opt out now please use our [**CONTACT FORM**](https://tolenaswinery.com/contact) and we will insure your information is never sold.

## RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION

Under the CCPA you are entitled to a "right to non-discrimination" in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right under CCPA. Our company does not discriminate its pricing or service for any consumer for any reason.

## QUESTIONS

If you have any questions about this policy please contact us using our [**CONTACT FORM**](https://tolenaswinery.com/contact).

## SHIPPING AND RETURNS

### SHIPPING

For any questions please contact us by using our[** CONTACT FORM**](https://tolenaswinery.com/contact).

All packages are shipped using a third party shipper. During the winter and summer months, weather conditions and longer delivery times can often result in the spoilage of your order. Expedited delivery options tend to be worth the added expense in order to protect your investment.

You will be notified by email when your wines are shipped. Generally, we will attempt to ship your wines shortly after your order is placed. However, in effort to protect your wine, please be aware that your order may be held for ideal weather and shipping conditions.

Due to ever changing direct-shipping laws and regulations, the list of states that we ship to may change at any time. All wines are sold in California and title passes to the buyer in California. We will arrange for shipment on behalf of the buyer, to an address specified by the buyer, provided that in our sole discretion we believe that such shipment will not subject us to the risk of any sort of legal action or other harm. If a buyer lives in a state where the direct shipment of wine may violate the law, we will contact the buyer to discuss shipping options, which options may include provision of an alternative shipping address in a state where the direct shipment of wines to consumers is permitted or storage of the wines at an acceptable third-party storage facility.

### RETURNS

All wines sold are maintained at optimum conditions. We consider wine to be out of our control once it has been handed over to the shipper and we cannot be responsible for improper storage after it has been delivered. Therefore, once your wine order has been picked up by the common carrier for delivery, the wine becomes your responsibility. We are not responsible for, and will not replace wine that is damaged by extreme weather conditions during shipment. We also cannot accept returns for the following: wines that do not coincide with personal tastes, wines that have been adversely affected by customer storage, and wines that have been otherwise damaged as a result of any other adverse condition occurring while the wines were in your care.

If wine is shipped back with bottles un-opened, we will refund your credit card for the cost of the wine less shipping and handling once it is received. If the original shipment was damaged or flawed you will receive a full refund, including shipping and handling charges.
