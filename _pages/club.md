## JOIN OUR WINE CLUB

As a Tolenas wine club member you’ll be a genuine Suisun Valley insider. As a small family run business you’ll see Vintners Lisa and Cliff Howard regularly, pouring wines, chatting with members and packing your shipments. Each club member receives a wine club welcome pack along with the benefits of club pricing on events, and wines as well as exclusive invitations for member only events.

Our tasting room is easily accessible just off I-80 from both Sacramento and the Bay Area. It makes for a quick day trip on quiet country roads to have a glass and a picnic.

Once you register, you will be contacted directly with more details on our next wine club pickup event and how to receive your wine club welcome pack.&nbsp;&nbsp;
